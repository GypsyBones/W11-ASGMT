[[MOC . CB . Week 11]]


##### **Coding Steps:**

- Using any of the tools you've worked with so far, create a game of Tic-Tac-Toe.
    - Create a Tic-Tac-Toe game grid using your HTML element of choice.
    - When a cell in the grid is clicked, an **X** or **O** should appear in that spot depending on whose turn it is.
    - A heading should say whether it is X's or O's turn and change with each move made.
    - A button should be available to clear the grid and restart the game.
    - When a player has won, or the board is full and the game results in a draw, a Bootstrap alert or similar Bootstrap component should appear across the screen announcing the winner.

##### **Reminder:**

- For this project and all remaining projects, you should have a file called **.gitignore** in your project directory. In that file you should have a line that says "/node_modules" without the quotes. This tells git to ignore all your node module dependencies when it pushes code to your repo.
- You should also have a file called **package.json** in your project directory. Please make sure this file gets pushed to your Github repo with all your other project files. This file is a manifest or list of all dependencies that your project requires to function properly. With this file someone can clone your repo and then run "npm install" in the project directory and they will automatically download all the node module dependencies needed.
- In particular, the graders will be cloning your repo (using git clone [https://github.com/YourUserName/YourRepoName](https://github.com/YourUserName/YourRepoName)) and then installing all the dependencies (using npm install). They can then test your project locally on their machine. It is recommended you run these commands at least for this project to make sure you can clone and run your project locally. If you have trouble doing that, please ask for help before submitting it.
